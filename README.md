# oi
trivia on the command line

full docs coming soon, use ```oi --help``` for full usage information

### dependencies

on all platforms the only thing you need installed is cargo

### build instructions:

clone repo

cd into repo root

run ```cargo build --release```

then for convenience copy ```./target/release/oi``` to somewhere in your $PATH
(on linux this would be something like ```/usr/local/bin```, not sure what location to use for other systems)

I'll be providing pre compiled binaries for all platforms in the releases section soon
